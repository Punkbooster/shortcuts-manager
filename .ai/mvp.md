### Main Problem

Manually finding, learning, and organizing keyboard shortcuts across different applications and operating systems is time-consuming and inefficient, hindering user productivity.

### Minimum Feature Set

* **Browse and Explore Shortcuts:** Allow users to view a curated database of shortcuts, categorized by operating system (e.g., Windows, macOS) and specific applications (e.g., Chrome, Word). Include basic on-the-fly filtering by OS and application.
* **Search by Application Name:** Enable users to search for all shortcuts associated with a specific application by typing its name.
* **Manage Shortcuts within Groups:** Users will be able to CRUD shotcuts in the existing groups.
* **User Sign-up and Sign-in:** Implement a simple user authentication system to allow users to save their created groups and the shortcuts within them.
* **CRUD Shortcut Groups:** Users can CRUD named shortcut groups for specific applications or workflows. Fields: shortcut group name.
* **CRUD Shortcut Items in the Shortcut Groups:** Users can CRUD their custom shortcut items from their shortcut groups. Fields: shortcut item name, shortcut item description.

### What's NOT included in the MVP

* Advanced Filtering Options (initially only by OS and application)
* Exploring the Shortcut Data API
* Detailed UI/UX Design Enhancements (initial focus on core functionality)
* Mobile Applications (web application only for MVP)
* User Profiles and Personalization Beyond Saved Groups

### Success Criteria
