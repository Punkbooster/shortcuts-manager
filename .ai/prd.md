# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Shortcut Management Web Application
## 1. Product Overview

This product requirements document outlines the requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of a web application designed to help users discover, learn, manage, and organize keyboard shortcuts for various operating systems and software applications. The application aims to improve user productivity by making it easier to find and utilize shortcuts. The MVP will focus on core functionalities including Browse and searching a shortcut database, creating and managing user-defined shortcut groups, and managing shortcuts within those groups, all while ensuring basic user authentication.

## 2. User Problem

Manually finding, learning, and organizing keyboard shortcuts across different applications and operating systems is time-consuming and inefficient, hindering user productivity. Users often struggle to remember the vast number of shortcuts available and lack a centralized system to manage them effectively.

## 3. Functional Requirements

The web application will provide the following core functionalities:

* **Shortcut Browse:** Users will be able to browse a database of shortcuts categorized by Operating System (e.g., Windows, macOS) and Application (e.g., Chrome, Word). Basic on-the-fly filtering will be available based on the selected OS and Application.
* **Shortcut Search:** Users will be able to search for shortcuts by entering the name of an application. The application will display all shortcuts associated with that application.
* **Shortcut Group Management:** Registered users will be able to perform CRUD operations on named shortcut groups. The only required field for creating a group will be the "Shortcut Group Name".
* **Shortcut Management within Groups:** Registered users will be able to perform CRUD operations on shortcut items within their created shortcut groups. The required fields for a shortcut item will be "Shortcut Item Name" and "Shortcut Item Keys". Users will be able to add existing shortcuts from the application's database to their groups.
* **User Authentication:** The application will provide user sign-up and sign-in functionality to allow users to save and access their created shortcut groups and the shortcuts within them.

## 4. Project Scope/Boundaries

The following features are explicitly excluded from the MVP:

* Advanced filtering options beyond Operating System and Application.
* Exploration and integration of an external API for shortcut data.
* Detailed UI/UX design enhancements and advanced styling. The initial focus will be on core functionality and usability.
* Mobile applications for iOS and Android platforms. The MVP will be a web application only.
* User profiles with personalization features beyond saving groups and shortcuts.
